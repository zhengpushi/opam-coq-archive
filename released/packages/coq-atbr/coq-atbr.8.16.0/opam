synopsis: "Coq library and tactic for deciding Kleene algebras"
description: """
This library provides algebraic tools for working with binary relations.
The main tactic provided is a reflexive tactic for solving (in)equations
in an arbitrary Kleene algebra. The decision procedure goes through
standard finite automata constructions.

Note that the initial authors consider this library to be superseded
by the Relation Algebra library, which is based on derivatives
rather than automata: https://github.com/damien-pous/relation-algebra"""
