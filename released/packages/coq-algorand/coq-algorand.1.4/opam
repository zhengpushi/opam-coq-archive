synopsis: "A verified model of the Algorand consensus protocol in Coq"
description: """
The Algorand consensus protocol is the foundation of a decentralized
digital currency and transactions platform. This project provides a
model of the protocol in Coq, expressed as a transition system over
global states in a message-passing distributed system. Included is
a formal proof of safety for the transition system."""
