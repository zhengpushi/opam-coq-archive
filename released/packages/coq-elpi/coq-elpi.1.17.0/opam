synopsis: "Elpi extension language for Coq"
description: """
Coq-elpi provides a Coq plugin that embeds ELPI.
It also provides a way to embed Coq's terms into λProlog using
the Higher-Order Abstract Syntax approach
and a way to read terms back.  In addition to that it exports to ELPI a
set of Coq's primitives, e.g. printing a message, accessing the
environment of theorems and data types, defining a new constant and so on.
For convenience it also provides a quotation and anti-quotation for Coq's
syntax in λProlog.  E.g. `{{nat}}` is expanded to the type name of natural
numbers, or `{{A -> B}}` to the representation of a product by unfolding
 the `->` notation. Finally it provides a way to define new vernacular commands
and
new tactics."""
