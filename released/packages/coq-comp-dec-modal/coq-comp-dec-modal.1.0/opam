synopsis: "Constructive proofs of soundness and completeness for K, K*, CTL, PDL, and PDL with converse"
description: """
This project presents machine-checked constructive proofs of
soundness, completeness, decidability, and the small-model property
for the logics K, K*, CTL, and PDL (with and without converse).

For all considered logics, we prove soundness and completeness of
their respective Hilbert-style axiomatization. For K, K*, and CTL,
we also prove soundness and completeness for Gentzen systems (i.e.,
sequent calculi).

For each logic, the central construction is a pruning-based
algorithm computing for a given formula either a satisfying model of
bounded size or a proof of its negation. The completeness and
decidability results then follow with soundness from the existence
of said algorithm.
