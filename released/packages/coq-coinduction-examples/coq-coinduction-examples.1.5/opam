synopsis: "Examples on how to use the coq-coinduction library, for doing proofs by (enhanced) coinduction"
description: """
Coinductive predicates are greatest fixpoints of monotone functions.
The `companion' makes it possible to enhance the associated coinduction scheme.
The coq-coinduction library provides tools to exploit such techniques; the present library illustrates its usage on three examples: divergence, Milner's CCS, and Rutten's stream calculus.
