synopsis: "Exploration of some properties of Kirby and Paris' hydra battles, with the help of Coq"
description: """
An exploration of some properties of Kirby and Paris' hydra battles,
with the help of the Coq Proof assistant. This development includes
the study of several representations of ordinal numbers, and a part
of the so-called Ketonen and Solovay machinery (combinatorial
properties of epsilon0)."""
