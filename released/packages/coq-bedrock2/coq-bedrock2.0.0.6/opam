synopsis: "A work-in-progress language and compiler for verified low-level programming"
description: """
bedrock2 is a low-level systems programming language. This language is
equipped with a simple program logic for proving correctness of the
programs.  A verified compiler targeting RISC-V from this language
exists in the coq-bedrock2-compiler package on opam.

The project has similar goals as bedrock, but uses a different design.
No code is shared between bedrock and bedrock2.
