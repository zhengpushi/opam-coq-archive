synopsis: "Coq formalization of validating labelled state transition and message production systems"
description: """
The theory of Validating Labelled State transition and Message
production systems (VLSMs) enables describing and proving properties
of distributed systems executing in the presence of faults. This
project contains a formalization of this theory in the Coq proof
assistant along with several examples of distributed protocols
modeled and verified using VLSMs, including the ELMO
(Equivocation-Limited Message Observer) family of message
validating protocols and the Paxos protocol for crash-tolerant
distributed consensus."""
