synopsis: "A Coq library for time and date arithmetic according to the UTC standard with leap seconds" # One-line description
description: """
FV Time is a library for managing conversions between time formats (UTC and
timestamps), as well as commonly used functions for time arithmetic. As a
library for time conversions, its novelty is the implementation of leap
seconds (which are part of the UTC standard but usually not implemented in
commercial libraries).
