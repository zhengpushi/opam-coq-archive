synopsis: "Graph neural network that predicts tactics for Tactician"
description:
  "Graph2Tac is a novel neural network architecture for predicting appropriate
  tactics for proof states. The crucial innovation of Graph2Tac is that it can
  build an understanding of the math concepts in an entire Coq development and
  all of its dependencies on-the-fly. That is, it analyzes the structure of
  definitions and lemmas and builds an internal representation of each object
  in the global context. Then, when presented with a proof state that
  references these mathematical concepts, Graph2Tac can leverage its deep
  knowledge to predict tactics and arguments."
