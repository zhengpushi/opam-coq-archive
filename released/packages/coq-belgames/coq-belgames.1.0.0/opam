synopsis: "BelGames: A Formal Theory of Games of Incomplete Information Based on Belief Functions in the Coq Proof Assistant"
description: """
We extend Bayesian games to the theory of belief functions. We
obtain a more expressive class of games we refer to as BelGames. It
makes it possible to better capture human behaviors with respect to
lack of information.
Next, we prove an extended version of the so-called
Howson--Rosenthal's theorem, showing that BelGames can be turned
into games of complete information, i.e., without any uncertainty."""
