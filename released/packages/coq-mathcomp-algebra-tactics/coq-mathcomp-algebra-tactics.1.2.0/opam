synopsis: "Ring, field, lra, nra, and psatz tactics for Mathematical Components"
description: """
This library provides `ring`, `field`, `lra`, `nra`, and `psatz` tactics for
algebraic structures of the Mathematical Components library. The `ring` tactic
works with any `comRingType` (commutative ring) or `comSemiRingType`
(commutative semiring). The `field` tactic works with any `fieldType` (field).
The other (Micromega) tactics work with any `realDomainType` (totally ordered
integral domain) or `realFieldType` (totally ordered field). Algebra Tactics
do not provide a way to declare instances, like the `Add Ring` and `Add Field`
commands, but use canonical structure inference instead. Therefore, each of
these tactics works with any canonical (or abstract) instance of the
respective structure declared through Hierarchy Builder. Another key feature
of Algebra Tactics is that they automatically push down ring morphisms and
additive functions to leaves of ring/field expressions before applying the
proof procedures."""
