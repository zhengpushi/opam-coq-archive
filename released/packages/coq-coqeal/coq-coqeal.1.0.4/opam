synopsis: "CoqEAL - The Coq Effective Algebra Library"
description: """
This Coq library contains a subset of the work that was developed in the context
of the ForMath EU FP7 project (2009-2013). It has two parts:
- theory, which contains developments in algebra and optimized algorithms on mathcomp data structures.
- refinements, which is a framework to ease change of data representations during a proof."""
